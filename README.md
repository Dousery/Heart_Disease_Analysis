# Heart_Disease_Analysis
 This project focuses on the exploration and analysis of the heart disease dataset. The following steps cover basic analysis procedures including data loading, inspection, categorization, visualization, and outlier handling.

### `About Dataset:`
This heart disease dataset is curated by combining 5 popular heart disease datasets already available independently but not combined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes. The five datasets used for its curation are:

- Cleveland
- Hungarian
- Switzerland
- Long Beach VA
- Statlog (Heart) Data Set.

This dataset consists of 1190 instances with 11 features. These datasets were collected and combined at one place to help advance research on CAD-related machine learning and data mining algorithms, and hopefully to ultimately advance clinical diagnosis and early treatment.

### `Installation:`
To run this project, you need to have Python and the required libraries installed.

### `Usage:`
- Clone the repository.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the analysis script.

### `Steps:`
- Importing Libraries: Necessary libraries are imported.
- Loading and Checking Data: The dataset is loaded and initially inspected.
- Checking The Dataset: The shape, columns, information, and missing values of the dataset are checked.
- Detection of Categorical, Numeric, and Cardinal Values: Features in the dataset are categorized into categorical, numeric, and cardinal.
- Visualization of Categorical and Numerical Values: The distribution of categorical and numerical features is visualized.
- Feature Engineering: Relationships between features and outliers are explored using visualization techniques.
- Handling Outliers: Outliers are detected and processed.
